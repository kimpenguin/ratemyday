Building a chart that shows the error in predicting an individual's prediction of the day they are going to have versus their final thoughts on the day.

Technologies:
D3, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Sass

Notes: This was a learning exercise to build a visualization that would be thoughtful and interactive. My first D3 project, inspired by stock charts. I followed along to examples found on the web in order to create the candlestick charts.
